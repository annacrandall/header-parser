# API Project #2: Header Parser 

[![Run on Replit](https://replit.com/badge/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-headerparser/)](https://header-parser-project.annacrandall.repl.co)

## About 
This is my code for freeCodeCamp's Header Parser project for the Back End Development and API's certification. [You can find the challenge here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/request-header-parser-microservice). My project was built off [this boilerplate](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-headerparser/) provided by freeCodeCamp. Any feedback or improvements to my code are greatly welcomed!
